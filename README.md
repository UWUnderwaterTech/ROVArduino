ARDUINO SOFTWARE
----------------

The Arduino Software is broken down into 3 categories:

+	Stabilization: Library for stabilizing the ROV's motion. Makes use 
		of the Pololu MinIMU + Arduino AHRS Library
+ 	Hardware: Represents and handles interfacing with the various hardware components
+ 	Serial: A simplified version of Bill Porter's EasyTranser Arduino Library
